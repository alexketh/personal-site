# Intro

Hey, I'm Alex Keth, a seasoned Junior Software Engineer with over a year of expertise in Vue.js, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. In my recent role at Fire Engine RED, I contributed to enterprise-level, SaaS-based software in Agile/Scrum environments, utilizing AWS, Vue.js, LEMP stack, Jira, Bitbucket, and Bamboo CI. My diverse background includes experiences as a Recreation Assistant and Sales Associate, showcasing discipline, organizational skills, and customer-focused sales techniques. A California State University-Sacramento graduate, I bring a strong foundation in software engineering and a commitment to continuous learning. I'm eager to contribute to innovative projects and open to new challengesâ€”let's connect!

# Some history

- At 14, I built my first PC with an i5-4690k and GTX 760.
- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included League of Legends, COD: Black Ops 1/2, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
- At 18, I started my first semester of undergraduate at CSU, Sacramento.
- At 19, I finished my first year of college with a good understanding of Java.
- At 22, Valorant was released and potentially doomed me of my career due to my addiction to the game.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
